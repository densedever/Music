        <h3>Music Theory is Easy!</h3>

        <section class='rolling-content'>
          <p>A piano is a great place to start learning music because each note is exactly the same and plays the same way.</p>
          <p>Fire up <a href='https://virtualpiano.net'>Virtual Piano</a> and have a go at the keys!</p>
          <p>Having a whole mess of keys around you may be scary at first, but you don't need to learn much of anything to master all of them!</p>

          <p>The note that is central to all music is the note <em>middle C</em>, a <a href='http://www.szynalski.com/tone-generator/'>tone</a> of about 261.6 Hz.</p>

          <p>The first step to understanding music is learning the language in which it's written. This is called <em>musical notation</em> and is written on a template called a <em>grand staff</em>. Here is an example of one: </p>
          <img src='assets/grand-staff.png'>
          <p>Notes can go anywhere on the lines and spaces of the staff.</p>
          <p>If they go above, some small lines extend the staff for that one note. Those are called <em>ledger lines</em>.</p>
          <p>Here is an easy way to tell what each note is on the entire staff:</p>

          <p>On a staff, middle C looks like this:</p>

          <p>and is the connection point between the top and bottom staves. But what are those?</p>
